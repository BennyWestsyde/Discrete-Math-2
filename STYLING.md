## Styling Guide
***

#### **_Summary:_**
This styling guide has been constructed with the goal that the notes that are written are uniform and as easy to understand as possible. Each topic contains four sections: summary, definitions, example, and tricky things to remember.

#### **_Definitions:_**
- **Summary**
: A short, descriptive explaination of the topic that includes any key words that should be in the definitions section.
- **Definitions**
: A list of key terms and their definitions that are important in order to understanding the topic.
- **Example** 
: An example of the topic being utilized. This can include a walkthrough of a proof or an ascii art rendering of the topic (such as a tree or diagram)
- **Tricky Things to Remember**
: A bullet pointed list of things that should be kept in mind/mistakes that should be avoided when working with this topic.

#### **_Example:_**

In order to do any kind of ascii art, you will need to use a code block. You can begin and end a code block with three backtick ` characters. This keeps Markdown from rendering the text inside the block so you will not end up with a wonky ascii drawing.
