# **Welcome to the Discrete Math 2 Repository!**

I am creating this in order to store and organize my notes as well as to have a record of the concepts we have learned throughout Discrete Math 2. As the semester continues, this repository will be updated and expanded (as best as possible) to ensure it remains a up to date.

## **_THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!_** 

This project is going to be most effective (and most up to date) if everyone participates, and I'd be very excited for you to contribute. If you have any important topics or insights that you believe would be valuable to include, please feel free to commit your ideas to the repository.

## **_Not Sure How to Help?_**

There are lots of ways that you can contribute to the repository! Whether you would like to add a new topic to an existing page, create an entirely new page, or even just make ascii art that visually represents topics like trees or diagrams, any and all contributions are appreciated.

Additionally, I will be making notes of the things that I am hoping to implement in the "[issues](https://github.com/BennyWestsyde/Discrete-Math-2-Study-Guide/issues)" tab. So, if you want to contribute, but don't know what you can add that should have some good places to start.

## **_Getting Started_**

All you will need to get started editing in the repository is a github account. It is free and shouldn't be difficult at all to set up. This repository is written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), a writing syntax that makes things look pretty. It's increadibly simple to use and, since this is hosted on Github, you can write it in your browser. All you need to do is navigate to the file you want to edit and press button with a little pen in the top right corner. Additionally, I have composed a [styling guide](https://github.com/BennyWestsyde/Discrete-Math-2-Study-Guide/blob/main/STYLING.md) that will make the notes uniform. 

Once you have finished your changes, *please provide a short description of what you have added* and press the "propose changes" button.

### **_It's as easy as that!_**
